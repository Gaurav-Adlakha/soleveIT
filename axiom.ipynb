    "Week 2: News-to-Factor Mapping\n",
    "Build a system that identifies which risk factors a news article affects. Start with keyword dictionaries for the main style factors. Articles mentioning \"earnings growth\" or \"revenue expansion\" map to the Growth factor. \"Market selloff\" or \"index decline\" maps to Market Sensitivity. \"Debt concerns\" or \"leverage ratios\" map to the Leverage factor.\n",
    "Test this mapping with real financial news. You'll quickly discover that most news affects multiple factors. An article about \"tech stocks rallying on strong earnings\" affects Growth, Momentum, and specific tech industries. Build your system to handle multiple factor tags per article.\n",
    "Create industry detection using the 68 GICS categories from the Axioma model. News about \"semiconductor shortage\" should map to the Semiconductors industry factor. \"Oil prices\" maps to Energy sectors.\n",

    "Week 3: Risk-Weighted Scoring\n",
    "Implement the core scoring algorithm that combines three elements: entity matching strength, factor relevance, and risk contribution.\n",
    "When news mentions a portfolio company directly, check which factors the news affects. Then check that company's exposure to those factors. If the news is about momentum and the company has high momentum exposure, that's a strong alignment. Multiply this alignment score by the position's risk contribution to get the final relevance score.\n",
    "For indirect matches (industry or country news), follow the same pattern but with lower base scores. News about \"European banking regulation\" should score highest for European banks in your portfolio, especially those with high regulatory risk exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Week 4: Validation and Tuning\n",
    "Test with real portfolios having different risk profiles. A growth portfolio should surface different news than a value portfolio, even if they hold some of the same stocks. The scoring should reflect each position's actual risk contribution, not just its market value weight.\n",
    "Compare your scores against actual market movements. High-scoring news should correspond to larger position moves. Track which factor mappings work well and which need refinement.\n",
    "Build reporting that shows why each news item scored as it did. Users should see that a news item ranked high because it affects the Growth factor, the portfolio has 30% risk exposure to Growth, and three large positions have high Growth sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Improvements from Original Plan\n",
    "Instead of arbitrary point values (10 for direct mention, 5 for industry), scores now reflect actual portfolio risk. A news item about a small position with minimal risk contribution naturally scores lower than news about a major risk driver.\n",
    "The system now understands factor interactions. News about \"value stocks outperforming growth\" is relevant to any portfolio with significant value-growth factor spread, even if no specific holdings are mentioned.\n",
    "Risk contributions update daily as market conditions change. A position that becomes more volatile automatically gets higher news priority without changing the scoring rules.\n",
    "This approach answers the question \"How much could this news impact my portfolio's risk?\" rather than just \"Is this news about my stocks?\" It's the difference between a simple keyword matcher and a risk-aware prioritization system."

Large companies are usually more stable but grow slower, while small companies can be more volatile but have higher growth potential. In our model, higher Size values = bigger companies.\n",

    "\n",
