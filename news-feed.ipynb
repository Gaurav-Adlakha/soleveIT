    "**Profile Management System**\n",
    "Create a user profile system that captures what matters to each person - their stock holdings, industry focus, business type, geographic location, and custom keywords. This profile becomes the lens through which all news gets filtered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content Analysis Engine**\n",
    "Build a text processing system that extracts key entities from each article - company names, stock tickers, industries, locations, and important keywords. You'll need named entity recognition to identify companies and potentially some basic sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matching and Scoring Algorithm**\n",
    "Create a scoring system that compares each article against a user's profile. An article mentioning Apple gets high priority for someone holding AAPL stock. An article about California regulations gets medium priority for someone running a business there. Score each match from 0-10 based on relevance strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prioritization Interface**\n",
    "Build a simple web interface that shows articles ranked by their personal relevance score. High-priority items appear first with clear indicators of why they matter (e.g., \"Affects your TSLA position\"). Include the ability to quickly dismiss or save articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alert System**\n",
    "Set up notifications for articles scoring above a certain threshold (maybe 8/10). This could be email, SMS, or push notifications for truly critical news that demands immediate attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feedback Loop**\n",
    "Track which articles users actually read and engage with, then use this data to refine your scoring algorithm over time. If someone consistently ignores certain types of \"high priority\" news, adjust their profile accordingly.\n",

    "**Estimation:** Constrained robust linear regression using Huber weight function and square-root USD capitalization weights. Style, industry and country factors are included in the regression. Local factors are estimated via an auxiliary regression on the residuals. The capitalization-weighted industry and country factor returns are each constrained to sum to zero. Currency factor returns are computed directly from exchange rates against USD.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Base Scoring:**\n",
    "- Company name match: +5 points\n",
    "- Stock ticker match: +3 points  \n",
    "- Each risk factor keyword: +1 point\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risk Multiplier:**\n",
    "- If article contains crisis words (\"risk\", \"volatility\", \"regulation\", \"crisis\", \"shortage\", \"disruption\"): multiply by 1.5x\n",
    "- Otherwise: multiply by 1.0x\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Score:**\n",
    "- Cap at 10 maximum\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Article: \"Tesla faces battery shortage crisis\"\n",
    "- \"Tesla\" (company name): +5\n",
    "- \"battery\" (risk factor): +1\n",
    "- \"shortage\" + \"crisis\" (crisis words): 1.5x multiplier\n",
    "- Final: (5+1) × 1.5 = 9/10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this works:**\n",
    "- Direct company mentions get highest priority\n",
    "- Multiple risk factors compound the score\n",
    "- Crisis language amplifies urgency\n",
    "- Score reflects potential financial impact on your portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "The system automatically identifies which news matters most to your investments without you reading every article.\n",
