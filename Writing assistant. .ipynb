    "4. Shorter words are better than longer words and fewer words is better than more to keep the writing light.\n",
    "5. Avoid multiple examples if one clear point suffices\n",
    "6. Make questions genuinely neutral rather than telegraphing the answer\n",
    "7. Remove sentences that restate the premise: After introducing a concept, don't add a sentence explaining why it matters trust the reader understands from context.\n",
    "8. Cut transitional fluff: Avoid sentences like \"Understanding X helps you Y\" or \"This is important because...\" Jump straight to the actionable content.\n",
    "9. Combine related ideas: Instead of \"X is important. X helps with Y. Here's how X works...\" just say \"X helps with Y: [explanation]\"\n",
    "10. Trust the reader's intelligence.\n",
    "11. Start sections with the meat: Lead with specific advice, not general statements about importance or benefits.\n",
    "12. Replace em dashes with simpler punctuation: Use periods, commas, or colons instead of em dashes unless truly needed for emphasis or clarity.\n",
    "13. Cut qualifying phrases: Remove phrases like \"if you focus on the right features\" or \"when done correctly\" that don't add concrete information.\n",
    "14. Use direct statements: Instead of \"X is importantâ€”here's why\" just state what X does.\n",
    "15. Remove setup phrases: Delete phrases like \"It's worth noting that\" or \"The key point is\" and just state the point directly."
