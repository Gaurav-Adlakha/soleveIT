    "`CrossEntropyLossFlat` is a wrapper around PyTorch's CrossEntropyLoss that handles input flattening automatically, making it more convenient to use in deep learning pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me explain the key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cross Entropy Loss**: This measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability distribution over classes. It increases as the predicted probability diverges from the actual label.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Flattening**: The \"Flat\" part refers to automatically reshaping (flattening) inputs to work with PyTorch's CrossEntropyLoss, which expects specific dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works intuitively:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import torch\n",
    "import torch.nn.functional as F\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basic cross entropy in PyTorch requires specific dimensions\n",
    "# pred shape: [batch_size, num_classes, ...]\n",
    "# target shape: [batch_size, ...]\n",
    "def basic_cross_entropy(pred, target):\n",
    "    return F.cross_entropy(pred, target)\n",
    "\n",
    "# CrossEntropyLossFlat automatically handles reshaping\n",
    "def cross_entropy_flat(pred, target):\n",
    "    # Flatten predictions to [batch_size*..., num_classes]\n",
    "    pred_flat = pred.view(-1, pred.shape[1]) if pred.dim() > 2 else pred\n",
    "    # Flatten targets to [batch_size*...]\n",
    "    targ_flat = target.view(-1) if target.dim() > 1 else target\n",
    "    return F.cross_entropy(pred_flat, targ_flat)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example with image classification predictions\n",
    "batch_size, num_classes = 2, 3\n",
    "# Predictions: [batch_size, num_classes]\n",
    "pred = torch.randn(batch_size, num_classes)\n",
    "# Targets: [batch_size]\n",
    "target = torch.tensor([0, 2])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Regular cross entropy works fine here\n",
    "loss1 = basic_cross_entropy(pred, target)\n",
    "# CrossEntropyLossFlat does the same thing\n",
    "loss2 = cross_entropy_flat(pred, target)\n",
    "print(f\"Regular: {loss1:.4f}, Flat: {loss2:.4f}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# But with 2D targets (like image segmentation), regular CE needs reshaping\n",
    "pred_img = torch.randn(2, 3, 4, 4)  # [batch, classes, height, width]\n",
    "target_img = torch.randint(0, 3, (2, 4, 4))  # [batch, height, width]\n",
    "\n",
    "# CrossEntropyLossFlat handles this automatically\n",
    "loss_img = cross_entropy_flat(pred_img, target_img)\n",
    "print(f\"Image segmentation loss: {loss_img:.4f}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The key benefit is that you don't need to manually reshape your data before calculating the loss, which is especially helpful with image segmentation or sequence prediction tasks."

    "**Focal Loss for Imbalanced Tabular Data (Churn Prediction)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In churn prediction, you typically have an imbalanced dataset:\n",
    "- Most customers (e.g., 95%) stay with your service (non-churn)\n",
    "- Few customers (e.g., 5%) leave your service (churn)\n",

    "**Problem with Standard Cross Entropy:**\n",
    "- Your model might predict \"no churn\" for everyone and still be 95% accurate\n",
    "- But this model is useless since it never identifies customers at risk of churning\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Focal Loss helps with churn prediction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatic focus on difficult examples:**\n",
    "   - As your model gets good at identifying obvious loyal customers, Focal Loss reduces their impact\n",
    "   - Customers who are misclassified (especially those who churn but are predicted as non-churn) maintain high impact\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Balanced learning without explicit resampling:**\n",
    "   - You don't need to artificially oversample the churning customers\n",
    "   - The model naturally pays more attention to the minority class examples it's getting wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Practical impact:**\n",
    "   - Your model becomes better at identifying subtle patterns that indicate potential churn\n",
    "   - It might achieve lower overall accuracy but much higher recall for the churn class\n",
    "   - This gives you a chance to intervene with at-risk customers before they leave\n",
