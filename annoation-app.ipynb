    "trace_data = {\n",
    "    \"request\": {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Question\"}]},\n",
    "    \"response\": {\"messages\": [\n",

    "    ]}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Patterns\n",
    "- HTML elements nest like boxes: `Container(Grid(Div(...), Form(...)))`\n",
    "- Use `*` to unpack lists: `Select(*options)` not `Select(options)`\n",
    "- FastCore's `L()` adds useful methods like `.map()`\n",
    "- `dict2obj()` enables dot notation access\n",
    "- Grid automatically creates responsive columns\n",
