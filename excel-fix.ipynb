    "Yes, pandas has a built-in way to handle this with the `explode()` function. First, you need to split the values in each cell into a list, then use `explode()` to create a row for each element in those lists. Here's how you can do it:\n",

    "# Step 1: Split the Eschool column values on newlines and 'or'\n",
    "df_split = df.copy()\n",
    "df_split['Eschool_list'] = df['Eschool'].fillna('').str.replace(r'\\\\nor\\\\n', '\\n', regex=True).str.split('\\n')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Explode the dataframe to create a row for each element\n",
    "df_exploded = df_split.explode('Eschool_list')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Clean up any extra whitespace and strip elements\n",
    "df_exploded['Eschool_list'] = df_exploded['Eschool_list'].str.strip()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show the result\n",
    "df_exploded[['S.No', 'Eschool_list', 'PowerSchoolFields']].head(10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will:\n",
    "1. Split values by newlines (handling both the '\\n' and '\\nor\\n' patterns)\n",
    "2. Create a new row for each value in the list\n",
    "3. Clean up whitespace in the resulting values\n",
    "\n",
    "Each resulting row will maintain all the columns from the original dataframe, but with just one of the split values in the new 'Eschool_list' column."
